## Basic Usage

### Command syntax

adb basic syntax of the command is as follows:

```sh
adb [-d|-e|-s <serialNumber>] <command>
```

If only one device / emulator connection, you can omit the `[-d | -e | -s <serialNumber>]` this part, the direct use `adb <command>`.

### Targeting equipment for command

If you have more than one device / emulator connection, you need to specify the target device for the command.

| Parameter           | Meaning                                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -d                  | Specifies currently the only Android device USB connector as the command target   |
| -e                  | Specify currently the only goal for the command to run the simulator              |
| `-s <SerialNumber>` | Specifies the device number corresponding serialNumber / simulator command target |

In the case of multiple devices / simulators are connected to the more common `-s <serialNumber>` parameters, serialNumber can be obtained through `adb devices` command. Such as:

```sh
$ adb devices

List of devices attached
cf264b8f	device
emulator-5554	device
```

Output in the `cf264b8f` and` emulator-5554` is serialNumber. For example, this time I want to specify `cf264b8f` this equipment to run the adb command to take a screen resolution:

```sh
adb -s cf264b8f shell wm size
```

Encountered multiple devices / simulators use the case of these parameters for the command to specify the target device, hereinafter to simplify the description will not be repeated.

### Start/Stop

Start adb server command:

```sh
adb start-server
```

(Generally no need to manually execute this command, when you run the command adb adb server if found does not start automatically from the transfer.)

Stop adb server command:

```sh
adb kill-server
```

### View adb version

command:

```sh
adb version
```

Sample output:

```sh
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.36
Revision 8f855a3d9b35-android
```

### Run adbd as root

The operating principle is adb adb server daemon and the phone side PC side adbd establish a connection, then the PC side adb client via adb server forward command parsing after running adbd receive commands.

So if adbd ordinary rights to perform some require root privileges to execute the command can not be directly used `adb xxx` execution. Then you can then execute the command `adb shell` after` su`, but also allows adbd root privileges to perform this high privilege can execute arbitrary commands.

command:

```sh
adb root
```

Normal output:

```sh
restarting adbd as root
```

Now run `adb shell`, take a look at the command line prompt is not turned into a` `#?

After some phone root can not let adbd by `adb root` execute commands with root privileges, some models such as Samsung, will be prompted to` adbd can not run as root in production builds`, then you can install adbd Insecure, then `adb root` try.

Accordingly, if you want to restore adbd non-root privileges, you can use `adb unroot` command.

### Designated adb server network port

command:

```sh
adb -P <port> start-server
```

The default port is 5037.

## Device connection management

### Inquiries connected device / simulator

command:

```sh
adb devices
```

Example output:

```sh
List of devices attached
cf264b8f	device
emulator-5554	device
```

Output format is `[serialNumber] [state]`, serialNumber that is, we often say that the SN, state the following categories:

* `Offline` - indicates that the device is not connected to the success or unresponsive.

* `Device` - device is connected. Note that this state does not identify the Android system has been fully activated and operational in the device during startup device instance can be connected to the adb, but after boot the system before it becomes operational.

* `No device` - no device / emulator connection.

The output shows the current connected the two devices / simulators, `cf264b8f` and` emulator-5554` are they SN. As can be seen from the `emulator-5554` name it is an Android emulator.

Common alarm output:

1. No device / emulator connection is successful.

   ```sh
   List of devices attached
   ```

2. The device / emulator is not connected to adb or unresponsive.

   ```sh
   List of devices attached
   cf264b8f	offline
   ```

### USB connection

USB connection normal use adb by the need to ensure that:

1. Hardware status is normal.

   Including Android devices in the normal power state, USB cable and interface intact.

Developer Options 2. Android devices and USB debugging mode is on.

   You can go to the "Settings" - "Developer options" - "Android Debug" view.

   If you can not find the developer options in the settings, it needs to make it through an egg is displayed: In the "Settings" - "About phone" continuous click "version number" 7 times.

3. The device driver is normal.

   It seems to worry about the Linux and Mac OS X, the Windows likely to be encountered in the case of the need to install drivers, this can be confirmed right "Computer" - "Properties", the "Device Manager" in view on related equipment Is there a yellow exclamation point or question mark, if not explain the driving state has been good. Otherwise, you can download a mobile assistant class program to install the driver first.

4. Status after confirmation via USB cable connected computers and devices.

   ```sh
   adb devices
   ```

   If you can see

   ```sh
   xxxxxx device
   ```

   Description Connection successful.

### Wireless connection (need to use the USB cable)

In addition to the USB connection to the computer to use adb, can also be a wireless connection - although the connection process is also step using USB needs, but after a successful connection to your device can get rid of the limit of the USB cable within a certain range it !

Steps:

1. Connect Android device to run adb computer connected to the same local area network, such as connected to the same WiFi.

2. The device connected to the computer via a USB cable.

   Make sure the connection is successful (you can run `adb devices` see if you can list the device).

3. Allow the device listens on port 5555 TCP / IP connections:

   ```sh
   adb tcpip 5555
   ```

4. Disconnect the USB connection.

5. Find the IP address of the device.

   Generally the 'Settings' in - "About phone" - "state information" - "IP address" is found, you can also use the following in the [View device information - IP address][1] a Lane method adb command.

6. Connect the device via IP address.

   ```sh
   adb connect <device-ip-address>
   ```

   Here `<device-ip-address>` is the IP address of the device found in the previous step.

7. Confirm the connection status.

   ```sh
   adb devices
   ```

   If you can see

   ```sh
   <device-ip-address>:5555 device
   ```

   Description Connection successful.

If you can not connect, verify that Android devices and the computer is connected to the same WiFi, then execute `adb connect <device-ip-address>` that step again;

If that does not work, by `adb kill-server` restart the adb and then try it all over again.

**The wireless connection**

command:

```sh
adb disconnect <device-ip-address>
```

### Wireless connection (without using the USB cable)

**Note: You need root privileges.**

On a "wireless connection (need to use USB cable)" method is described in official documents, need the help of a USB cable to enable the wireless connection.

Since we want to achieve a wireless connection, it can all step down are wireless it? The answer is energy.

1. Install a terminal emulator on the Android device.

   Equipment already installed you can skip this step. Terminal emulator download address I use is: [Terminal Emulator for Android Downloads](https://jackpal.github.io/Android-Terminal-Emulator/)

2. To run the Android device and computer adb is connected to the same local area network, such as connected to the same WiFi.

3. Open a terminal emulator on your Android device, in which run the command sequence:

   ```sh
   su
   setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555
   ```

4. Find the IP address of the Android device.

   Generally the 'Settings' in - "About phone" - "state information" - "IP address" is found, you can also use the following in the [View device information - IP address][1] a Lane method adb command.

5. Connect Android device on a computer via adb and IP addresses.

   ```sh
   adb connect <device-ip-address>
   ```

   Here `<device-ip-address>` is the IP address of the device found in the previous step.

   If you can see `connected to <device-ip-address>: 5555` such output indicates a successful connection.

* Notice: *
   Some device may not working unless you restart adbd service, so you need to run command on the device's terminal as below

   ```sh
   restart adbd
   ```

   if `restart` is not working, try following command:

   ```sh
   start adbd
   stop adbd
   ```

## Application Management

### Check the list of

Check the list of basic commands format

```sh
adb shell pm list packages [-f] [-d] [-e] [-s] [-3] [-i] [-u] [--user USER_ID] [FILTER]
```

That is the basis of `adb shell pm list packages` can add some parameters on the filter to view different lists, supports filtering parameters are as follows:

| Parameter  | display list                             |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| No         | all applications                         |
| -f         | Display apk file application association |
| -d         | Show only applications disabled          |
| -e         | Show only enabled applications           |
| -s         | Display only System                      |
| -3         | Show only third-party application        |
| -i         | Display applications installer           |
| -u         | Contains uninstall applications          |
| `<FILTER>` | package name contains `<FILTER>` strings |

#### All applications

command:

```sh
adb shell pm list packages
```

Example output:

```sh
package:com.android.smoketest
package:com.example.android.livecubes
package:com.android.providers.telephony
package:com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox
package:com.android.providers.calendar
package:com.android.providers.media
package:com.android.protips
package:com.android.documentsui
package:com.android.gallery
package:com.android.externalstorage
...
// other packages here
...
```

#### system applications

command:

```sh
adb shell pm list packages -s
```

#### third-party usage

command:

```sh
adb shell pm list packages -3
```

#### Application package name contains a string

For example, to view a list of package names that contain the string `mazhuang` applications, order:

```sh
adb shell pm list packages mazhuang
```

Of course, you can also use grep to filter:

```sh
adb shell pm list packages | grep mazhuang
```

### Install APK

Format:

```sh
adb install [-lrtsdg] <path_to_apk>
```

parameter:

`Adb install` may be followed by some optional parameters to control the behavior of the installation APK, available parameters and their meanings are as follows:

| Parameter | Meaning                                                                                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -l        | Will be applied to protect the installation directory / mnt / asec                                        |
| -r        | Allowed to cover the installation                                                                         |
| -t        | Allowed to install application specified in AndroidManifest.xml `android: testOnly =" true "` Application |
| -s        | Install apps to sdcard                                                                                    |
| -d        | Downgrade coverage allows installation                                                                    |
| -g        | Grant all runtime permissions                                                                             |

After you run the command to see if similar to the following output (status is `Success`) represents the installation was successful:

```sh
[100%] /data/local/tmp/1.apk
	pkg: /data/local/tmp/1.apk
Success
```

The above is the output of adb current latest version v1.0.36, it will push apk file to display the progress of the percentage of mobile phones.

Using older versions of adb output is this:

```sh
12040 KB/s (22205609 bytes in 1.801s)
        pkg: /data/local/tmp/SogouInput_android_v8.3_sweb.apk
Success
```

If the status is `Failure` said installation failure, such as:

```sh
[100%] /data/local/tmp/map-20160831.apk
        pkg: /data/local/tmp/map-20160831.apk
Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS]
```

Common Installation failed output code, the meaning and possible solutions are as follows:

| Output                                             | Meaning                                                                                                                                       | solutions                                                                    |

*`Adb install` internal principle Introduction*

`Adb install` actually three steps:

1. push apk files to / data / local / tmp.

2. Call pm install installation.

3. Delete the corresponding apk file / data / local / tmp under.

Therefore, when necessary, according to this step, manually step through the installation process.

### Uninstalling

command:

```sh
adb uninstall [-k] <packagename>
```

`<Packagename>` represents the application package name, `-k` optional parameter indicates uninstall the application but keep the data and cache directories.

Command Example:

```sh
adb uninstall com.qihoo360.mobilesafe
```

Uninstall represents 360 mobile guards.

### Clear app cache data

command:

```sh
adb shell pm clear <packagename>
```

`<Packagename>` represents the name of the application package, the effect of this command is equivalent to the application information in the settings screen, click the "Clear Cache" and "Clear data."

Command Example:

```sh
adb shell pm clear com.qihoo360.mobilesafe
```

360 mobile guards to clear the data and cache.

### View Reception Activity

command:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep mFocusedActivity
```

Example output:

```sh
mFocusedActivity: ActivityRecord{8079d7e u0 com.cyanogenmod.trebuchet/com.android.launcher3.Launcher t42}
```

Where `com.cyanogenmod.trebuchet / com.android.launcher3.Launcher` is currently in the foreground Activity.

### View Running Services

command:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys activity services [<packagename>]
```

`<packagename>` parameter is optional, command with `<packagename>` will output services related with that packagename, and command without `<packagename>` will output all services.

Complete packagename is unnecessary. For example, `adb shell dumpsys activity services org.mazhuang` will output services related with `org.mazhuang.demo1`, `org.mazhuang.demo2` and `org.mazhuang123`, etc.

## Interact with Applications

The most used syntax for interacting with applications is : 
```sh
am <command>
```
The common commands for `<command>` are as follow:

| Command                           | Use                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `start [options] <INTENT>`        | Start an Activity specified by `<INTENT>`            |
| `startservice [options] <INTENT>` | Start the Service specified by `<INTENT>`            |
| `broadcast [options] <INTENT>`    | Send a broadcast `<INTENT>`                         |
| `force-stop <packagename>`        | Force stop everything associated with `<packagename>`|

The `<INTENT>` is a flexible parameter which is corresponding to the Intent writing in the application.

The options for `<INTENT>` are as follows:

| Parameter        | Meaning                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-a <ACTION>`    | Specify the intent action, such as `android.intent.action.VIEW`. You can declare this only once.                                                                                |
| `-c <CATEGORY>`  | Specify an intent category, such as `android.intent.category.APP_CONTACTS`                                                                    |
| `-n <COMPONENT>` | Specify the component name with package name prefix to create an explicit intent, such as `com.example.app/.ExampleActivity` |

There are some options addting data for `<INTENT>`, similar to `extra` for Bundle:

| Parameter                                                        | Meaning                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--esn <EXTRA_KEY>`                                              | null value (only key name)             |
| `-e|--es <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_STRING_VALUE>`                       | string value                           |
| `--ez <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_BOOLEAN_VALUE>`                         | boolean value                          |
| `--ei <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_INT_VALUE>`                             | integer value                          |
| `--el <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_LONG_VALUE>`                            | long value                             |
| `--ef <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_FLOAT_VALUE>`                           | float value                            |
| `--eu <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_URI_VALUE>`                             | URI                                    |
| `--ecn <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_COMPONENT_NAME_VALUE>`                 | component name                         |
| `--eia <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_INT_VALUE> [, <EXTRA_INT_VALUE ...]`   | integer array                          |
| `--ela <EXTRA_KEY> <EXTRA_LONG_VALUE> [, <EXTRA_LONG_VALUE ...]` | long array                             |

### Start an Activity

The syntax is:

```sh
adb shell am start [options] <INTENT>
```

For example:

```sh
adb shell am start -n com.tencent.mm/.ui.LauncherUI
```

The command above means starting the launch activity of WeChat.

```sh
adb shell am start -n org.mazhuang.boottimemeasure/.MainActivity --es "toast" "hello, world"
```

The command above means starting MainActivity of the application with the package name `org.mazhuang.boottimemeasure` with an extra string information (key is 'toast' and value is 'hello, world').

### Start a Service

The syntax is:

```sh
adb shell am startservice [options] <INTENT>
```

For example:

```sh
adb shell am startservice -n com.tencent.mm/.plugin.accountsync.model.AccountAuthenticatorService
```

The command above means starting a service from WeChat.

### Send a broadcast

The syntax is:

```sh
adb shell am broadcast [options] <INTENT>
```

Broadcast intent can be sent to all components or a specified component.

For example, the command of issuing a broadcast intent with `BOOT_COMPLETED` to all of the components is as following:

```sh
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED
```

As another example of issuing a broadcast intent with `BOOT_COMPLETED` only to `org.mazhuang.boottimemeasure / .BootCompletedReceiver` is as following:

```sh
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED -n org.mazhuang.boottimemeasure/.BootCompletedReceiver
```

The command of issuing a broadcast intent is very useful in the test, especially when a broatcast intent is hard to generate normally, it would be of great use to send the broadcast intent by the command.

Both system predefined and custom broadcast intent are able to be sent. The following is part of the system predefined broadcast intents and the triggers:

| Action                                          | Trigger                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

| android.intent.action.DREAMING_STARTED          | system starts dreaming                                                 |
| android.intent.action.DREAMING_STOPPED          | system stops dreaming                                                 |
| android.intent.action.WALLPAPER_CHANGED         | wallpaper changeed                                                  |

*(Above broadcast intents are all available to be sent via adb commands)*

### Force stop an application

The syntax is:

```sh
adb shell am force-stop <packagename>
```

For example:

```sh
adb shell am force-stop com.qihoo360.mobilesafe
```

The command above means stopping all processes and services related to the package name `com.qihoo360.mobilesafe`.

## File Management

### Copy files from a device to a computer

command:

```sh
adb pull <remote> [local]
```
> - `remote`: file path on device
> - `local`: directory on computer

The `local` parameter is optional, the default value is current directory.

For example:

```sh
adb pull /sdcard/sr.mp4 ~/tmp/
```

- *Tips*: The file from device may be not readable without root permission, you need to make sure your device is rooted and then use `adb shell` and `su` commands to gain the root permission in the `adb shell` environment, after that you can use `cp /path/on/device /sdcard/filename` to copy the target file from those directories which require root permission to a public directory, and finaly you can use `adb pull /sdcard/filename /path/on/pc` normally as mentioned above after exiting the `adb shell` environment.

### Copy files from a computer to a device

command:

```sh
adb push <local> <remote>
```
> - `local`: file path on computer
> - `remote`: directory on device

For example:

```sh
adb push ~/sr.mp4 /sdcard/
```

- *Tips*: The directory on device may be not writable without root permission, you need to make sure your device is rooted and then use `adb push /path/on/pc /sdcard/filename` firstly, and use `adb shell` and `su` to gain the root permission in the `adb shell` environment, and finaly use `cp /sdcard/filename /path/on/device` to copy the file to the target directory.

## Analog Keys / inputs

In `adb shell` there is a very useful command called` input`, through which you can do some interesting things.

`Complete help information input` command is as follows:

```sh
Usage: input [<source>] <command> [<arg>...]

The sources are:
      mouse
      keyboard
      joystick
      touchnavigation
      touchpad
      trackball
      stylus
      dpad
      gesture
      touchscreen
      gamepad

The commands and default sources are:
      text <string> (Default: touchscreen)
      keyevent [--longpress] <key code number or name> ... (Default: keyboard)
      tap <x> <y> (Default: touchscreen)
      swipe <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> [duration(ms)] (Default: touchscreen)
      press (Default: trackball)
      roll <dx> <dy> (Default: trackball)
```

Such as using `adb shell input keyevent <keycode>` command, different keycode to achieve different functions, keycode complete list see [KeyEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html), I think the interesting part of the quote is as follows:

| Keycode | Meaning                                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

```

### Slide to unlock

If no password lock screen is unlocked by sliding gestures, so you can `input swipe` to unlock.

Command (parameter models Nexus 5, swipe up to unlock, for example):

```sh
adb shell input swipe 300 1000 300 500
```

`3001000300 parameters represent` 500` starting x coordinate of the start point y coordinate of the end point x coordinate y coordinate of the end point '.

### Enter text

When the focus is in a text box, you can enter text by `input` command.

command:

```sh
adb shell input text hello
```

`Hello` now appear in the text box.

## View Log

Log Android system is divided into two parts, the underlying Linux kernel log output to / proc / kmsg, Android's log output to / dev / log.

### Android log

Format:

```sh
[adb] logcat [<option>] ... [<filter-spec>] ...
```

Common usage are listed below:

### Filter the log by level

Android log divided into the following levels:

* V - Verbose (lowest output most)
* D - Debug
* I - Info
* W - Warning
* E - Error
* F - Fatal
* S - Silent (highest, what is not output)

Press a grade level and above filter log is the log output.

For example, the command:

```sh
adb logcat *:W
```

Will Warning, Error, Fatal and Silent log output.

(**Notice:** tag `*` must surrounded with double quotation, like `adb logcat "*:W"`, otherwise an error `no matches found *:W` would throws.)

#### Filter by tag and log level

filterspecs are a series of `<tag>[:priority]`.

For example, the command:

```sh
adb logcat ActivityManager:I MyApp:D *:S
```

Represents an output tag `ActivityManager` above the level of Info logs, Debug log output above the level of the tag` MyApp`, and other tag Silent level of log (ie, shield other tag logging).

#### Log format

You can use `adb logcat -v <format>` option specifies log output format.

Log supported by the following `<format>`:

* brief

  The default format. The format is:

  ```sh
  <priority>/<tag>(<pid>): <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  D/HeadsetStateMachine( 1785): Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0
  ```

* process

  The format is:

  ```sh
  <priority>(<pid>) <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  D( 1785) Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0  (HeadsetStateMachine)
  ```

* tag

  The format is:

  ```sh
  <priority>/<tag>: <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  D/HeadsetStateMachine: Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0
  ```

* raw

  The format is:

  ```sh
  <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0
  ```

* time

  The format is:

  ```sh
  <datetime> <priority>/<tag>(<pid>): <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  08-28 22:39:39.974 D/HeadsetStateMachine( 1785): Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0
  ```

* threadtime

  The format is:

  ```sh
  <datetime> <pid> <tid> <priority> <tag>: <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  08-28 22:39:39.974  1785  1832 D HeadsetStateMachine: Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0
  ```

* long

  The format is:

  ```sh
  [ <datetime> <pid>:<tid> <priority>/<tag> ]
  <message>
  ```

  Example:

  ```sh
  [ 08-28 22:39:39.974  1785: 1832 D/HeadsetStateMachine ]
  Disconnected process message: 10, size: 0
  ```

Specified format can be used simultaneously with the above filter. such as:

```sh
adb logcat -v long ActivityManager:I *:S
```

#### Clear log

```sh
adb logcat -c
```

### Kernel log

command:

```sh
adb shell dmesg
```

Example output:

```sh
<6>[14201.684016] PM: noirq resume of devices complete after 0.982 msecs
<6>[14201.685525] PM: early resume of devices complete after 0.838 msecs
<6>[14201.753642] PM: resume of devices complete after 68.106 msecs
<4>[14201.755954] Restarting tasks ... done.
<6>[14201.771229] PM: suspend exit 2016-08-28 13:31:32.679217193 UTC
<6>[14201.872373] PM: suspend entry 2016-08-28 13:31:32.780363596 UTC
<6>[14201.872498] PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
```

In brackets `[14201.684016]` time represents the core begins to start in seconds.

By kernel log, we can do some things, such as a measure of the kernel boot time, `Freeing init memory` find that time is in front of the line after system startup, the kernel log.

## View device information

### Model

Command:

```sh
adb shell getprop ro.product.model
```

Sample output:

```sh
Nexus 5
```

### Battery Status

Command:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys battery
```

Sample output:

```sh
Current Battery Service state:
  AC powered: false
  USB powered: true
  Wireless powered: false
  status: 2
  health: 2
  present: true
  level: 44
  scale: 100
  voltage: 3872
  temperature: 280
  technology: Li-poly
```

`Scale` means the maximum value of `level`, and `level` means the current battery level. The output above means there is 44% of battery left of the device.

### Screen Resolution

Command:

```sh
adb shell wm size
```

Sample output:

```sh
Physical size: 1080x1920
```

The above output means the device's screen resolution is 1080px * 1920px.

If resolution has been changed by command, the output would be like this:

```sh
Physical size: 1080x1920
Override size: 480x1024
```

It means the original resolution of the screen is 1080px * 1920px, and currently it is 480px * 1024px.

### Screen density

Command:

```sh
adb shell wm density
```

Sample output:

```sh
Physical density: 420
```

The output shows the density of the device is 420dpi.

If screen density has been changed by command, the output would be like this:

```sh
Physical density: 480
Override density: 160
```

It means the original density of the screen is 480dpi, and currently it is 160dpi.

### Display Parameters

Command:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys window displays
```

Sample output:

```sh
WINDOW MANAGER DISPLAY CONTENTS (dumpsys window displays)
  Display: mDisplayId=0
    init=1080x1920 420dpi cur=1080x1920 app=1080x1794 rng=1080x1017-1810x1731
    deferred=false layoutNeeded=false
```

The `mDisplayId` stands for the number of the display screen, `init` shows the initial resolution and density of the screen, the height in `app` is smaller than that in `init`, which means the device has a virtual navigation bar with a height: `1920 - 1794 = 126px (42dp)`.

### android\_id

Command:

```sh
adb shell settings get secure android_id
```

Sample output:

```sh
51b6be48bac8c569
```

### IMEI

For Android 4.4 and the belows, the IMEI viewing command is like this:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys iphonesubinfo
```

Sample output:

```sh
Phone Subscriber Info:
  Phone Type = GSM
  Device ID = 860955027785041
```

`Device ID` stands for IMEI.

For Android 5.0 and the aboves, the command used to view IMEI above is not working which always comes out nothing, the alternative is like this(requires root privileges):

```sh
adb shell
su
service call iphonesubinfo 1
```

Sample output:

```sh
Result: Parcel(
  0x00000000: 00000000 0000000f 00360038 00390030 '........8.6.0.9.'
  0x00000010: 00350035 00320030 00370037 00350038 '5.5.0.2.7.7.8.5.'
  0x00000020: 00340030 00000031                   '0.4.1...        ')
```

After extracting the data the normal IMEI will show, such as the IMEI above is `860955027785041`.

Reference: [adb shell dumpsys iphonesubinfo not working since Android 5.0 Lollipop](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27002663/adb-shell-dumpsys-iphonesubinfo-not-working-since-android-5-0-lollipop)

### Android system version

Command:

```sh
adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release
```

Sample output:

```sh
5.0.2
```

### IP address

Are you getting bored for pressing "Setting" - "About phone" - "state information" - "IP address" to get the IP address of the device? You can make it easily via adb command:

Command:

```sh
adb shell ifconfig | grep Mask
```

Sample output:

```sh
inet addr:10.130.245.230  Mask:255.255.255.252
inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
```

The IP address of the device is `10.130.245.230`.

The above command may result in an empty result on some devices if they are connected via WIFI, then you can use the following command to view the LAN IP:

```sh
adb shell ifconfig wlan0
```

Sample output:

```sh
wlan0: ip 10.129.160.99 mask 255.255.240.0 flags [up broadcast running multicast]
```

or

```sh
wlan0     Link encap:UNSPEC
          inet addr:10.129.168.57  Bcast:10.129.175.255  Mask:255.255.240.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::66cc:2eff:fe68:b6b6/64 Scope: Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:496520 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:68215 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:3000
          RX bytes:116266821 TX bytes:8311736
```

If the two commands above still don't get the desired information, then you can try the following command (available in some system):

```sh
adb shell netcfg
```

Sample output:

```sh
wlan0    UP                               10.129.160.99/20  0x00001043 f8:a9:d0:17:42:4d

```

It shows the network connection name, connection enable status, IP address, Mac address and etc.

### Mac Address

Command:

```sh
adb shell cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/address
```

Sample output:

```sh
f8:a9:d0:17:42:4d
```

The output above is the Mac address of LAN, if you want other infomation of connection, the command `adb shell netcfg` mentioned in the section **IP address** would be helpful.

### CPU Information

Command:

```sh
adb shell cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

Sample output:

```sh
Processor       : ARMv7 Processor rev 0 (v7l)
processor       : 0
BogoMIPS        : 38.40

processor       : 1

Revision        : 000b
Serial          : 0000000000000000
```

This is the CPU information of Nexus 5, we can find from the output that the hardware is `Qualcomm MSM 8974`, and the processor number is from 0 to 3, which means the cpu is a quad-core, then from the `Processor` we can find the architecture of the cpu is` ARMv7 Processor rev 0 ( v71) `.

`MemTotal` means the total memory of the device, and `MemFree` means the current free memory.

### More hardware and system properties

More hardware devices and system properties can be obtained by the following command:

```sh
adb shell cat /system/build.prop
```

This will output a lot of information, including "model" and "Android system version" and other infomation which are mentioned in previous several sections.

In output also includes some other useful information, which can also be obtained individually via the command `adb shell getprop <attribute name>`:

| Attribute name                  | Meaning                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ro.build.version.sdk            | SDK version                   |
| ro.build.version.release        | Android system version        |
| ro.build.version.security_patch | Android security patch level  |
| ro.product.model                | Type                          |
| ro.product.brand                | Brands                        |
| ro.product.name                 | device name                   |
| ro.product.board                | Processor Model               |
| ro.product.cpu.abilist          | CPU supported abi list[Ref 1]   |
| persist.sys.isUsbOtgEnabled     | OTG supports                  |
| dalvik.vm.heapsize              | limit on heap size for each app |
| ro.sf.lcd_density               | screen density                |

*Ref 1*:
The property of abi list may be changed in some custom ROMs, if it can't be obtained via `ro.product.cpu.abilist`, you can try this command:
```
adb shell cat /system/build.prop | grep ro.product.cpu.abi
```

Sample output:
```
ro.product.cpu.abi=armeabi-v7a
ro.product.cpu.abi2=armeabi
```
## Modify Settings

**Notice:** Display may not normal after reset settings, you can use command `adb reboot` to reboot device, or reboot it maually.

### Resolution

command:

```sh
adb shell wm size 480x1024
```

It means change the resolution to 480px * 1024px.

Reset to original resolution:

```sh
adb shell wm size reset
```

### Screen density

command:

```sh
adb shell wm density 160
```

It means change the screen density to 160dpi.

Reset to original screen density:

```sh
adb shell wm density reset
```

### Overscan

command:

```sh
adb shell wm overscan 0,0,0,200
```

Four parameters are left, top, right and bottom margin pixels to the edge, command above means leave 200px in screen bottom clean.

Reset to original overscan:

```sh
adb shell wm overscan reset
```

### Turn off Android Debug

command:

```sh
adb shell settings put global adb_enabled 0
```

To reset:

We can't do this via command now, because without "Android Debug" on, adb cannot communicate with Devices.

So just do it on device manually:

"Settings" - "Developer options" - "Android Debug".

### Show/hide status bar or navigation bar

Settings in this section correspond with "Expanded desktop" in Cyanogenmod.

command:

```sh
adb shell settings put global policy_control <key-values>
```

`<key-values>` composite by keys and their values below, format is `<key1>=<value1>:<key2>=<value2>`.

| key                   | meaning             |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| immersive.full        | Hide both           |
| immersive.status      | Hide status bar     |
| immersive.navigation  | Hide navigation bar |
| immersive.preconfirms | ?                   |

Values for these keys are comma-delimited list of tokens, where tokens:

| value          | 含义             |
|----------------|------------------|
| `apps`         | All applications |
| `*`            | Everywhere       |
| `packagename`  | Include package  |
| `-packagename` | Exclude package  |

For example:

```sh
adb shell settings put global policy_control immersive.full=*
```

Means set hide both status bar and navigation bar everywhere.

```sh
adb shell settings put global policy_control immersive.status=com.package1,com.package2:immersive.navigation=apps,-com.package3
```

Means set hide status bar in applications whoes package name is `com.package1` or `com.package2`, hide navigation bar in all applications, exclude whoes package name is `com.package3`.

## Utility functions

### Screenshots

command:

```sh
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/sc.png
```

And then export the png file to your computer:

```sh
adb pull /sdcard/sc.png
```

You can use the `adb shell screencap -h` See` help screencap` command, here are two significant parameters and their meanings:

| Parameter     | Meaning                                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -p            | Save the file in png format specified                                        |
| -d Display-id | screenshots display the specified number (multiple screen display case next) |

Found If you specify a file name can be omitted when the -p parameter to `.png` ending; otherwise you need to use the -p parameter. If you do not specify a file name, file contents screenshot will be directly output to stdout.

Save screenshot file to computer with a single line command:

```sh
adb shell screencap -p | sed "s/\r$//" > sc.png
```

This depends on `sed` command, it's avaliable in Linux and Mac OS X by default. In Windows, you may find it in bin directory in Git installation place. Otherwise, you may need to download [sed for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm) and add the directory where sed.exe is to PATH environment variable.

### Recording Screen

Record screen are saved in mp4 format to / sdcard:

```sh
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/filename.mp4
```

When you need to stop press <kbd> Ctrl-C </ kbd>, the default recording time and maximum recording time is 180 seconds.

If you need to export to your computer:

```sh
adb pull /sdcard/filename.mp4
```

You can use the `adb shell screenrecord --help` See` help screenrecord` command, the following are common parameters and their meanings:

| Parameter           | Meaning                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --size WIDTHxHEIGHT | dimensions of the video, such as `1280x720`, default screen resolution. |
| --bit-Rate RATE     | bit-rate video, the default is 4Mbps.                                   |
| --time-Limit TIME   | recording length, in seconds.                                           |

### Remount system partition as writable

**Note: You need root privileges.**

/system partitions are mounted read-only, but some operating systems such as Android to add commands to remove the need to bring their own application / system write operation, it is necessary to remount it read-write.

step:

1. Enter the shell and switch to the root user privileges.

   command:

   ```sh
   adb shell
   su
   ```

2. View the current partition mounted case.

   command:

   ```sh
   mount
   ```

   Example output:

   ```sh
   rootfs / rootfs ro,relatime 0 0
   tmpfs /dev tmpfs rw,seclabel,nosuid,relatime,mode=755 0 0
   devpts /dev/pts devpts rw,seclabel,relatime,mode=600 0 0

   /dev/fuse /mnt/shell/emulated/0 fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1023,group_id=1023,default_permissions,allow_other 0 0
   ```

   Find one of our concerns with the / system of the line:

   ```sh
   /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/system /system ext4 ro,seclabel,relatime,data=ordered 0 0
   ```

3. remount.

   command:

   ```sh
   mount -o remount,rw -t yaffs2 /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/system /system
   ```

   Here `/ dev / block / platform / msm_sdcc.1 / by-name / system` is we get the file path from the output in the previous step.

If the output is not an error, then the operation is successful, you can file / system under wanted.

### Check connection over WiFi password

**Note: You need root privileges.**

command:

```sh
adb shell
su
cat /data/misc/wifi/*.conf
```

Example output:

```sh
network={
	ssid="TP-LINK_9DFC"
	scan_ssid=1
	psk="123456789"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
	group=CCMP TKIP
	auth_alg=OPEN
	sim_num=1
	priority=13893
}

network={
	ssid="TP-LINK_F11E"
	psk="987654321"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
	sim_num=1
	priority=17293
}
```

`Ssid` we shall see in the WLAN settings in the name,` psk` the password, `key_mgmt` security encryption.

### To set the system date and time

** Note: You need root privileges. **

command:

```sh
adb shell
su
date -s 20160823.131500
```

It said it would change the system date and time at 13:15:00 on August 23, 2016.

### restart cellphone

command:

```sh
adb reboot
```

### Detect whether the device is root

command:

```sh
adb shell
su
```

In this case the command line prompt is `` $ indicates no root privileges, is `` the # indicates root.

### Monkey use stress testing

Monkey can generate pseudo-random event to simulate a user click, touch, gesture and other operations, you can program being developed random stress test.

Usage is simple:

```sh
adb shell monkey -p <packagename> -v 500
```

He told `<packagename>` specific application to send 500 pseudo-random events.

Monkey in detail with reference to the use of [official document](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkey.html).

### On / off WiFi

** Note: You need root privileges. **

Sometimes the need to control the device WiFi mode, you can use the following command to complete.

Open WiFi:

```sh
adb root
adb shell svc wifi enable
```

Close WiFi:

```sh
adb root
adb shell svc wifi disable
```

If successfully implemented, the output is empty; if not get root privileges to execute this command will fail, output `Killed`.

## common problem

### Start adb server failure

**Error message**

```sh
error: protocol fault (couldn't read status): No error
```

**Possible Causes**

adb server process wants to use 5037 port is occupied.

**solution**

Found consumes process 5037 port, and then terminate it. In Windows, for example:

```sh
netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING

...
TCP    0.0.0.0:5037           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       1548
...
```

1548 Here is the process ID, the process ends with the command:

```sh
taskkill /PID 1548
```

Then start adb no problem.
